# Workshop on Practical Considerations of LIME and SHAP

This repository contains the code of the Workshop diving into some of the practical considerations taken when utilising machine learning explaination methods LIME and SHAP.

## Preparation

For this tutorial, I've used two datasets which I've provided in the repository. However, if you wish to do this tutorial with your own dataset, please come prepared with a pre-processed dataset oriented towards classification. 

It is highly recommended that this tutorial is done on a virtual environment, to set up the virtual environment please run the following command. 



## Sources

This tutorial was adapted from several existing works that I've listed below alongside some extensions which may be interesting.
